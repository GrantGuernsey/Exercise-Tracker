## Mock User Profile
A mock user for this application is as follows


### Description:
This user is an individual who has recently committed to improving their fitness. With a busy work schedule, they prefer efficient workouts that target specific muscle groups and help track progress. They have intermediate experience in weightlifting but are looking for a better way to log workouts and monitor progress. They also want to calculate their one-rep max for each exercise to help push their strength gains further.

### How the User Uses the App:
- **Muscle Group Selection:** The user starts by choosing specific muscle groups, such as legs or chest, to create a balanced workout routine.
- **Tracking Sets and Reps:** During their workout, the user uses the app to quickly enter the number of sets, reps, and the weight used for each exercise. The appâ€™s intuitive interface allows for easy updates on the go.
- **Progress Monitoring:** After each session, the user checks the progress section to view their performance for each exercise, tracking improvements over time to stay motivated.
- **Custom Exercises:** Occasionally, the user tries new exercises and uses the app to input custom exercises that aren't already listed.
- **Workout Creation:** The user creates full workouts using the app, which can be easily copied, pasted, or shared with others.

### Goals:
- Increase strength and muscle size
- Track progress accurately and efficiently
- Maintain motivation with visual progress reports
